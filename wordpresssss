Hello Sir/Madam,

I am writing to resign from my position as wordpress junior developer at Squad Technologies. After 

much consideration, I have decided to move on to new opportunities and challenges in my career.


I have enjoyed my time at Squad Technologies over the past 1.8 years and appreciate the opportunities 

and experiences I have gained during my tenure. Working with the dedicated and talented team here has 

been a valuable learning experience, and I am grateful for the support and mentorship I have received.


I have accumulated 1.8 years of valuable experience in the IT 

field. Therefore, I kindly request an experience letter that outlines my roles, responsibilities, and 

achievements during my tenure at the company. This experience letter will be a valuable asset as I 

continue my career journey.


I also request a leaving letter that acknowledges my departure from Squad Technologies and specifies 

my last working day. This letter will help ensure a smooth transition and clear communication within 

the company.


I will ensure a smooth transition during my notice period by completing any pending work and providing 

documentation to assist my colleagues in my absence. If there are any specific tasks or 

responsibilities you would like me to prioritize during this period, please let me know, and I will do 

my best to accommodate.


I would like to express my gratitude to you and the entire Squad Technologies team for the support and 

camaraderie I have experienced here.


Thank you once again for the opportunities I've had at Squad Technologies, and I wish the company 

continued success in the future.


Sincerely,
Yogesh Shah
